# hello-world
Respitory first and new to me
What have I done, started playing with C in the 70's loved it but committments prevented me from following it up.  Now that I'm retired I should be fishing, playing golf etc etc but I want to code as a hobby.  Oh my goodness is there something wrong with me.
